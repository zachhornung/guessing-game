      <h2>Short Biography</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Zach! I'm 25, and I love music.<img id="guitar" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/0277f7_c317c9b3e8dc4b34aed6bc07f437fb4a~mv2.jpg"> Here's a quick autobiography. I graduated highschool, which I hated, in 2013. Right after highschool I went on a mountain biking trip with my dad and some people we met online. We rode our mountain bikes from Banff, Canada, to Antelope Wells, New Mexico along the continental divide. It was totally self supported, and it took us 50 days. there is a great documentary about it called Ride the Divide. I then went to college at Western Washington University. I flunked my first year, and went to work in Alaska at a fish processing plant. That prompted me to go back to school and I got back into WWU. I got a job as a cook at a restaurant at the same time, and held that job until after I graduated. I then got a job at Victory Millwork in Ferndale, WA, and worked up to Building Supervisor. I quit that job to work at Taylor Shelfish as a Supervisor after about 2 years. <div id="oyster"><img id="oysterpic" src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57a0b9e7414fb546e8e4e864/1472764171072-D7T3MH69AIRXKQSE0F5T/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kDHPSfPanjkWqhH6pl6g5ph7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z4YTzHvnKhyp6Da-NYroOW3ZGjoBKy3azqku80C789l0mwONMR1ELp49Lyc52iWr5dNb1QJw9casjKdtTg1_-y4jz4ptJBmI9gQmbjSQnNGng/20150604_140725.jpg"></div>That was my last job before enrolling in Codefellows. the oyster farmer job was a difficult job, working at all hours of the night in freezing temperatures, chest deep water in Samish Bay, holes in the waders, and in all weather conditions. I do not like working in the rain! That prompted me to go back to school, and I enrolled in Codefellows after a year or so of working as an oyster farmer. Some goals I have with coding are to become fluent in Python, and to get into the machine learning/ AI field.</p>
